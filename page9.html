            Be an act of Congress. A state of real existence rather than possibility. 
            And poets love possibility! They love to wonder and explore.
             Hard lot! But the poem, no matter how full of possibility, 
             has to exist! To conduct oneself, to behave. How a poem acts 
             marks its individual character. A poem by Glandolyn Blue does 
             not sound like a poem by Timothy Sure. to pretend, feign, impersonate. 
             That, too, yes and always, because self-consciousness is its own pretension, 
             and has been from its beginning; the human mind is capable of a great 
             elastic theatre. As the poet Ralph angel puts it, “The poem is an 
             interpretation of weird theatrical shit.” the weird theatrical shit 
             is what goes on around us every day of our lives; an animal of only 
             instinct, Johnny Ferret, has in his actions drama, but no theater; 
             heater requires that you draw a circle around the action and observe 
             it from outside the circle; in other words, self-consciousness is theatre.

            Everyone knows that if you query poets about how their poems begin, 
            the answer is always the same: a phrase, a line, a scrap of language, a rhythm, 
            an image, something seen, heard, witnessed, or imagined. And the lesson is always 
            the same, and young poets recognize this to be one of the most important lessons 
            they can learn: if you have any idea for a poem, an exact grid of intent, you are 
            on the wrong path, a dead-end alley, at the top of a cliff you haven’t even climbed. 
            This is a lesson that can only be learned by trial and error. I believe many fine poems 
            begin with ideas, but if you tell too many faces this, or tell it too loudly, they will 
            get the wrong idea. Now here is something really interesting (to me), something you can 
            use at a standing-up-only party when everyone is tired of hearing there are one million 
            three-thousand-two-hundred-ninety-five words used by the Esimo for snow. This is what 
            Ezra Pound learned from Ernest Fenollosa: Some languages are so constructed—English among 
            them—that we each only really speak one sentence in our lifetime. That sentence begins with 
            your first words, toddling around the kitchen, and ends with your last words right before you 
            step into the limousine, or in a nursing home, the night-duty attendant vaguely on hand. Or, if 
            you are blessed, they are heard by someone who knows you and loves you and will be sorry to hear 
            the sentence end. When I told Mr. Angel about the lifelong sentence, he said: 

        </div>
    
        <div class="ph3">
           
            “That’s a lot of semicolons!” he is absolutely right; 
            the sentence would be unwieldy and awkward and resemble the novel of a savant, 
            but the next time you use a semicolon (which, by the way, is the least-used mark of 
            punctuation in all of poetry) you should stop and be thankful that there exists this little 
            thing, invented by a human being—an Italian as a matter of fact—that allows us to go on and 
            keep on connecting speech that for all apparent purposes is unrelated.
