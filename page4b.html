                    the number of beginnings so far exceeds <br>
                    the number of endings that we cannot even  <br> 
                    conceive of it. Not every poem is finished  one <br> 
                    poem is abandoned, another catches fire and <br>
                    is carried away by the wind, which may be <br>
                    an ending, but it is the ending of a <br>
                    poem without an end.
