                Paul Valéry <span class="white"> the French poet and thinker once said that no poem is ever ended, that every 
                poem is merely abandoned. This saying is also attributed to Stéphane Mallarmé, 
                for where quotations begin is in a cloud.</span>

                Paul Valéry <span class="white">also <br>
                described his perception <br>
                of first lines so vividly, <br>
                and to my mind so<br>
                accurately, that i have<br>
                never forgotten it: <br>
                the opening line of a poem, <br>
                he said, is like finding a <br>
                fruit on the ground, a <br>
                piece of fallen fruit you <br>
                have never seen before, <br> 
                and the poet’s task is to <br>
                create the tre from which<br>
                such a fruit would fall.</span>
