                ...is a semicolon, a living semicolon, 
                what connects the first line to the last, the act of keeping 
                together that whose nature is to fly apart. Between the first and 
                last lines there exists—a poem—and if it were not for the poem 
                that intervenes, the first and last lines of a poem would not 
                speak to each other. Would not speak to each other. Because the 
                lines of a poem are speaking to each other, not you to them or they 
                to you. I will tell you what I miss: I 
                miss watching a movie and at the end, huge scrolled words 
                come on the screen and say: The End. I miss finishing a novel 
                and there on the last page, at a discrete distance from the last 
                words of the last sentence, are the dark letters spelling The End. 
                It was its own thrill. I didn’t ignore them, I read them, even if only silently, 
                with a deep sense of feeling: both the feeling of being replete, a feeling of 
                satisfaction, and the feeling of loss, the sadness of having finished the book. 
                <br>
                <br> 
                I have never, in my life, read a poem that ended with the words The End. 
                Why is that, I wonder. I think perhaps the brevity of poems compared to 
                novels makes one feel that there has been no great sustention of energy, 
                no marathon worthy of pulling tape across the finish line. And then 
                I found a poem of mine that I had carefully written by hand in the sixth 
                grade, and at the bottom of the page, in India ink, beautifully apart from 
                the rest of the text, were the words The End. And I realized children very 
                often denote the end because it is indeed a great achievement for them to 
                have written anything, and they are completely unaware of the number of 
                stories and poems that have already been written; they know some, of course,
                but have not yet found out the extent to which they are not the only persons 
                residing on the planet. And so they sign their poems and stories like kings. 
                Which is a wonderful thing.

                Roland Barthes suggests there are three ways to finish any piece of writing: 
                the ending will have the last word or the ending will be silent or the ending will 
                execute a pirouette, do something unexpectedly incongruent. Gaston Bachelard says 
                the single most succinct and astonishing thing: We begin in admiration and we end 
                by organizing our disappointment. The moment of admiration is the experience of 
                something unfiltered, vital and fresh—it could also be horror—and the moment of 
                organization is both the onset of disappointment and its dignification; 
                the least we can do is dignify our knowingness, the loss of some vitality 
                through familiarization, by admiring not the thing itself but how we can organize it, 
                think about it. I am afraid there is no way around this. It is the one try inevitable thing. 
                And if you believe that, then you are conceding that in the beginning was the act, not the word. 
                The painter Cy Twombly quotes John Crowe Ransom, on a scrap of paper: 
                “The image cannot be disposed of a primordial freshness which ideas can never claim.”
                Easy and appropriate thing for a painter to say. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Cy Twombly uses text in some of his drawings and paintings, usually poetry, usually Dante. Many men and women have written 
                long essays and lectures on the ideas they see expressed in Twombly’s work. 
                Bachelard’s sentence simply says this: origins (beginnings) have consequences (endings). 
                The poem is the consequence of its origins. Give me the fruit and I will take from it a see and 
                plant it and watch grow the tree from which it fell. Barbara Henstein Smith, in her book 
                Poetic Closure: A Study of How Poems End, says this: “Perhaps all we can say, and even this may be too much, 
                is that varying degrees or states of tension seem to be involved in all our experiences, and that the most 
                gratifying ones are those in which whatever tensions are created are also released. Or, to use another familiar set of terms, 
                an experience is gratifying to the extent that those expectations that are aroused are also fulfilled.”But there is no book 
                I know of on the subject of how poems begin. How can the origin be traced when there is no form or shape that precedes 
                it to trace? It is exactly like tracing the moment of the big bang—we can go back to a nanosecond before the beginning, 
                before the universe burst into being, but we can’t go back to the precise beginning because that would 
                precede knowledge, and we can’t “know” anything before “knowing” itself was born.
